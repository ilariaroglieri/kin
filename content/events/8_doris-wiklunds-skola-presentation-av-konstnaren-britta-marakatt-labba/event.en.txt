17:00–18:00 Doris Wiklund’s school, presentation by artist Britta Marakatt-Labba, 2nd floor

During the 1960s in Kiruna the celebrated artist Britta Marakatt-Labba learned how to weave from Doris Wiklund. From an early age Marakatt-Labba has devoted her time to the textile crafts and skills that Wiklund not only provided but also the consciousness of the rich traditions in the Nordic regions. Marakatt-Labba will present examples from her own linen closet.

Britta Marakatt-Labba was born in 1951 and grew up in a reindeer herding family in the Sámi village, Lainiovuoma. She began her artistic trajectory in 1979 after finishing her studies at the art industrial school in Gothenburg. Early on, together with other young Sámi artists, she engaged herself in the foundation of a Sámi artists’ organization. Today she lives and works in Saarivuoma and has been active as an artist for more than forty years. In 2017 she had an international break through when her twenty-four meter long embroidery Historja was exhibited at Documenta 14 in Kassel. She has received awards and cultural prizes for her art and artistic contributions. In 2024 Marakatt-Labba will have a major retrospective exhibition entitled “Sharp Stitches” at Nasjonalmuseet in Oslo as well as an abridged version at Kin Museum of Contemporary Art opening in October of the same year.
