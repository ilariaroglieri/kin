##Máttut mátki, mu mátki—the Journey of the Ancestors,
my Journey, a presentation by doujar Anna-Stina Svakko
17:00–18:00 
Kin Museum for Contemporary Art, 2nd floor
During Anna-Stina Svakko’s primary education and through friends in Kiruna, Doris Wiklund helped Svakko become conscious about the richness and presence in textile work, particularly weaving traditions from the north. Svakko will talk about what has shaped her own textile journey and what it means today to fully live for, and from, Sámi textiles. Born in Kiruna in 1967 with strong Sámi roots coming from Nedre Ratekjokk and Tornedalian backgrounds in Anttis, Svakko grew up with a crafting Sámi mother, which profoundlyinfluenced her choice of profession. With a diploma in duodji [Sámi craft] from1991 she works full time with duodji for the company Astu Design. In the studio in Porjus she creates traditional Sámi costumes, modern clothes, and textile art. In addition, she works frequently as a lecturer, course leader, and mentor. Currently she is involved in creating costumes for theatre plays which involve Sámi themes
