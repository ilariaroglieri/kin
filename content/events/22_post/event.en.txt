13:00 – 13:45 Post-capitalist Architecture and the Vernacular. 
A Tea Session Relating to Joar Nango and Ken Are Bongo’s Work with Kerstin Möller, Curatorlab**. In English.
This session offers an informal conversation inspired by the TV talk show Post-Capitalist Architecture TV Part 1: On Materiality and Resource Economy by Joar Nango and Ken Are Bongo. Framed within an informal tea session, the public is invited to join a discussion about Nango’s multilayered practice including his interest in vernacular architecture, the practice of Indigenous knowledges and material relations in contemporary architecture. The ways in which western knowledge and practices can learn from Sámi way of living will be discussed. Set against the backdrop of Kiruna, the particular context of the city centre being moved or torn down and its architecture being rebuilt, at the expense of the manifold heritages that are present in the city and region of Kiruna, will be further situated. How can such a restructuring of a city provide an opportunity to create a form of commons within shared (living) environments and relations beyond capitalist exploitation? The public is invited to participate. Tea and coffee will be served.
