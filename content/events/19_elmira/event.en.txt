##Saturday, February 17, Kin Museum of Contemporary Art, 5th floor 
15:00 – 15:45 Round table with Joanna Warsza, program director Curatorlab and artists Ilmira Bolotyan, Carin Ellberg, and Bernd Krauss. In English. 
The practices of all three artists involve walking, strolling, and traveling. In her work, Ilmira Bolotyan has followed women across Sápmi, persuing the questions and dialogues on what it means to be a woman in the European North. Carin Ellberg often strolls on the sandy beaches in Scania interacting with seaweed, jellyfish, and other organisms that inspire her work about the abundance of the sea organisms and their relations to all living being. While Bernd Krauss, in order to facilitate his walks around Södertälje near Stockholm, constructed a wooden third hand, a self-made cyborgish extension that would facilitate his relation with the outside world. Referring to the individual artists practices the very basic tools they all employ will be discussed—to walk, to see and to listen—in order to be seen, heard and met somewhere on the way.
