Info:

We offer tours on the current exhibitions for individual groups, large or small. The tours can be shorter, or longer and more in-depth, depending on the group's interests and needs. They can also be combined with a visit to the Art Workshop where a practical aesthetic exercise, a focused conversation and coffee can deepen the experience. The tours are free of charge.

Contact the art mediator (email: emma@konstmuseetinorr.se text: Emma Pettersson Juntti), for booking and more info.
