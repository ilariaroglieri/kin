Kin Museum for Contemporary Art, 2nd floor
Doris Wiklund, along with her weaving students, meticulously
documented traditional weavings from the northern reg
ion—a cultural treasure that had previously been overlooked. Th
is extensive work culminated in the 1993 publication of
Gamla vävnader från Norrbotten. The overwhelming interest in traditional northern weaving led to the rapid sell-out of the book’s first edition of 1000, prompting the printing of another edition. Building on Doris Wiklund’s foundational work, the discussion
will center on significant instances where artists and artisans
have reshaped history. Examining examples ranging from the
textile artists of the Artists’ Suffrage League (1907—ca. 1918) to
the exhibition Verkligheten sätter spår (1975), and including the
contributions of jewelry designer Rosa Taikon and glassworkers
from Småland between 1978–1983, the focus is on how these figures challenged established historical narratives. By delving into their stories, the conversation aims to explore alternative realities and narratives.
Christina Zetterlund, a craft - and design historian, serves as an
educator, curator, and researcher with a keen interest in historiography where design and craft
offer perspectives for investigating social conditions. She works as a design lecturer at Linnéuniversitet and, alongside Onkar Kular, served as the artistic leader for the Luleåbiennalen 2022–
Craft & Art. Zetterlund played a pivotal role in establishing Rosa Taikon’s archive at Hälsinglands Museum and led the research project Designhistorier i andra geografier
from 2021 to 2023, focusing on rewriting history with Småland and Sápmi as starting points.
