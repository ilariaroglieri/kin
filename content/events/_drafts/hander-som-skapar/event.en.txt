Located in Konstverkstan, floor 0,5

For thousands of years, women in the north have used their hands to craft using materials taken from nature. The knowledge has been passed on to the next generation and together people have learned crafting methods that still are and have been significant in the everyday life. The exhibition “Textile Magic with Doris Wiklund, Kristina Pashkova, Maja Fredin and Matilda Kenttä” running from February 15 – May 26 takes its point of departure from the legendary Kiruna-based weaver Doris Wiklund’s life and oevre.
Over the course of five Thursday evenings, starting Thursday, February 8, participants will be able to try out different traditional crafting techniques. At each meeting, we will focus on one woman and her form traditional craft along with one work from the exhibition “Textile Magic.” Bring something with you to craft with your hands. Refreshments will be served and socializing and exchange of knowledge are a guarantee—everyone is welcome!
