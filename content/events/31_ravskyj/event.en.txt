15:00–15:45: Displacement and Art in Exile
A Conversation with Artists Alexander Ravskyi, Alexandra Ravskaya, and Kirill Agafonov, moderated by Anastasia Shestak, Curatorlab. In English.
In each of their respective practices, all three artists capture their everyday life and surroundings through graphic works or found objects and storytelling. Their everyday routines are now very much affected by the large-scale invasion of Russia in Ukraine. The black lines of Alexander Ravskyi’s drawings trace the massive destruction of the architectural monuments from different Ukrainian cities—among them a theater, a school, and a house of culture. Alexandra Ravskaya’s paintings are more intimate, depicting, for example, herself and her partner embracing as an oil depot is exploding in the background. Artist Kirill Agafonov works with the found objects to offer new stories, raising questions such as “what constitutes the symbolic land on which you are permanently or temporarily based?” Focusing on the individual artists’ practices we will talk about displacement and art in exile, but also how to keep the connection and support each other during wartime.
