Info:

In February 2024 a new visual language for Kin was presented in conjunction with the museum’s reopening. At the core of this language are symbols and ornamentation from the local visual culture. 

Expanding on this concept, Kin’s recently introduced visual language extends to the translation of the new website's content into both Northern Sámi and Meänkieli languages, further embracing cultural diversity and inclusivity. 

In what ways can local cultural heritage influence the communication strategy of a museum for contemporary art?
