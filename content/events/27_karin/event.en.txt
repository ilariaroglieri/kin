A lecture on Doris Wiklund presented by archivist
at Norrbottens Museum, Karin Tjernström
17:00–18:00 
Kin Museum for Contemporary Art, 2nd floor
Doris Wiklund was raised in and works still to this day in Kiruna.
Over the course of nearly her entire life, Wiklund has been a promotor of the art of weaving and textile heritage in a multitude of ways.
As a weaving teacher, lecturer, and writer, she has inspired, guided, and generously bestowed her knowledge for others to l
earn from.
In her life-long work collecting, documenting, and analyzing old textile samples, she has not only kept but also opened up the cultural treasures for new g
enerations. In her art she has taken inspiration
from nature, human beings, and life in and around her
hometown of Kiruna. This lecture takes its starting point from the Doris Wiklund archive, donated to Norrbott
ens Museum in the summer of 2020.
