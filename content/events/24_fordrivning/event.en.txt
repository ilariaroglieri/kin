14:00 – 14:45 Artists Kultivator, Nina Svensson, and Anastasia Kizilova in conversation with Anastasia Shestak, Curatorlab. In English.
How to become friends with a forest? Can traditional tools teach us radical and experimental approaches? These questions as well as others will be raised with Nina Svensson, Anastasia Kizilova, and art and agriculture collective Kultivator, whose work is often placed outside the traditional artistic sphere. The practices of the artists involve dealing with forests, cultivation of the land, and relation to the communities and non-human inhabitants of the ground. Nina Svensson’s project Twin Forest is based on the idea of friendship and exchange of knowledge, between experts and other people through different forest plots in various countries. Anastasia Kizilova’s project Darwin’s Pot consists of a set of ceramic pots, each filled with earth in which earthworms can dwell. Referring to the individual artists’ practices, prudent, beneficial, and caring ways to deal with the forests, land, and communities will be discussed.
