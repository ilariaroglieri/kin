Workshop on territories and residencies with the artist Kirill Agafonov. In English. 
The artist Kirill Agafonov introduces his project “Embassy of Microterritories,” which he has been developing during the two years that have passed since he fled Russia after the invasion of Ukraine. The project circles around a briefcase attachéväska, more commonly known as an “attaché́’s briefcase,” which he fills with a variety of objects while travelling from the city Izhevsk in central Russia to Uzbekistan, and then further on to Sweden and Switzerland. With the help of the objects, the briefcase becomes a mini embassy with which he can initiate conversations about territories and residencies.
