Text:

Visit The Workshop on floor 0,5. With the works in the exhibitions as a starting point, together we draw, sculpture and experiment. Everything you create can be brought home. The Workshop welcomes children and adults and is open every weekend. There you will always find a meditator who will inspire and help you out. Saturday and Sunday 1—3.30pm. Drop-in. Free of charge.  

##Handicraft café 
Bring your needle work, knitting or crafting project and immerse yourself into the museum’s creative atmosphere. You can also start a new handicraft project inspired by the materials you find here. There is coffee, a pleasant company and exciting exhibitions to be inspired by. 
It is free of chage and everyone is welcome—young and old! No registration needed. Every other Sunday, odd weeks, 1—3pm in The Workshop, floor 0,5.
