##School holiday program 
During all school holidays, we offer special workshops, art camps and more frequent introductions than usual. Watch out for our program on our website under Program and on our social media channels. Everything is free of charge and open for everyone. Warmly welcome! 

##For teachers 
What do you notice in a work of art? What does it make you think about? Art is extraordinarily suitable for approaching the big issues in our contemporary world such as history, language, and society. We are pleased to welcome school groups and pre-school groups to meet the art with a guided tour and a session in The Workshop. Contact our art mediator (link: mailto:emma@konstmuseetinorr.se text: emma@kinmuseum.se). Warmly welcome!
